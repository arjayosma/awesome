I finally decided to start blogging about technology and software development in general. I enjoy turning ideas into useful applications and want to share notes about my encounters with the technologies I'm using.

## What's this all about

I've been doing **software development** (coding, programming, or call it whatever you want) for a little more than a decade already, working mainly with Java and the different flavors of JavaScript. Up until now, I still strike the keyboard with excitement about the different ideas that occasionally pop in my head.

In this blog, I'll be frequently sharing notes about the different topics I know touching Java and JavaScript.

### Why these languages

1. I am using them right now for my different projects and I love using them - I want to share ideas I confidently know.

2. These two are still rocking it up there in the top programming languages of [2020](https://dev.to/scand/top-programming-languages-to-use-in-2020-1nl5). [This](https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future) and [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e?gi=45454fbc062b). I don't believe that they will die out anytime soon.

3. I mostly get noteworthy moments when working with this bunch.

4. I want to learn more from sharing about them and by engaging in meaningful conversations.

From time to time, I may occasionally bring up other interesting topics such as cool technologies, relevant news, startup ideas, and business-related themes.

### Therefore

As the number of developers grows every day, I hope this blog provides the help that they need and present the answers they wish to see. Always remember to stay awesome!
